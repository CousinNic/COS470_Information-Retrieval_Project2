# COS470_Information-Retrieval_Project2

To run you must create a folder named Entities in the directory, then place posts.py in the folder. you must also place the blender stack exchange Posts.xml in the directory, along with post_parser_record.py.

once this is done run the code sections in order, NOTE(if you have not set up a gdrive properly skip the first Mount to gdrive section)

searches create files of top 1000 results, so in order to run fusion, or evaluation and comparision, include the qrel, along with the shortened run files that end with _5 to the directory.
